Hey ya. "This is the time," she breathed, "and this is the record of the
time." It's `like` this, and like that ya know. This *is* now.
This **was** then.

Now we're back to regular old text. Hey ya. "This is the time," she
breathed, "and this is the record of the time." It's `like` this, and
like that ya know. This *is* now. Hey ya. "This is the time," she
breathed, "and this is the record of the time." It's `like` this, and
like that ya know. This *is* now. Now consider the en--dash, or
even---for the fatuous---the em dash. Do they work?

Fetch some data?

<div id="data"></div>
<div id="data2"></div>

<script>
 var g = new Graph({element: '#data', width: 600, height: 300});
 var h = new Graph({element: '#data2', width: 600, height: 300});

 function fetch(p, g) {
   d3.json("http://api.littleredcomputer.net/sicm/driven")
     .header('content-type', 'application/json')
     .post(JSON.stringify(p), function(err, data) {
       if (err) throw err;
       g.draw(data.value);
     });
 }

 var P = { t: 100, dt: 1/100, omega: 2 * Math.sqrt(9.8), a: 0.1, theta_0: 1 };
 fetch(P, g);
 var Q = { t: 100, dt: 1/100, omega: 2 * Math.sqrt(9.8), a: 0.1, theta_0: 1, thetadot_0: 1e-10 };
 fetch(Q, h);
