Part 3 in a series of numerically integrating differential
equations in the browser with [odex][odex].
Here we have the [Lotka-Volterra][lv],
or "predator prey", equations. Move the mouse over the graph
to change the initial conditions. The top graph is the
predator/prey state against time; the bottom graph is the
phase portrait of the system.

  var l = odexdemo.predatorPrey();
  l.setup();
  l.draw();
